            <h2>Stangerville</h2>
            <p class="EasterEggs">
                The Sims 4 Game Pack Stangerville is a game pack that is a lot like the Netflix 
                hit show Stranger Things. Many of the things in the game pack reference the show 
                and some of the items even look very similar to what is in the show. 
            </p>
            <h2>Families</h2>
            <p class="EasterEggs">
                One of the families in the world is named the Roomies. When you look at them 
                you will notice that they look very familiar. Once you look into it you come 
                to find out the Sims are perfect copies of the cast of New Girl. 
            </p>

            <h2>Books</h2>
            <p class="EasterEggs">
                Many of the books in the game are also references to real books with just a 
                little spin in the name like one book called “Dusk Glow” it is a reference for 
                The Twilight Saga. Another is “Toy Tales” which is a reference to Toy Story. 
                There are many other books that are referencing real books. 
            </p>
            <h2>New Sim</h2>
            <p class="EasterEggs">
                When a baby is born there is a dialog box that pops up and says “life, the 
                universe and everything waits”, which is referencing Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s 
                Guide to the Galaxy series.
            </p>
            <h2>Baby Yoda</h2>
            <p class="EasterEggs">
                One of the ones I really like is that there is an item in the shop that you 
                can get called “The Child Statue” when you look at this item you can see that 
                it is Baby Yoda or Grogu from The Mandalorian.
            </p>
